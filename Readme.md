# Trading app

The requirement was to develop a HTML CSS to be used as a software frontend, the purpose of which was to help in trading app. Although I wanted to make it responsive but as per client's requirement I had to assume that the width would always be of a fixed size.

The main challenge was to develop the trading chart without using any charting library. So I developed the whole chart using svgs. The svg used here was developed by hand-on coding without using any tools.
